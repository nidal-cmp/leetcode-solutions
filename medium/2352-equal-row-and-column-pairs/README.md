# Equal Row and Column Pairs

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a 0-indexed n x n integer matrix grid, return the number of pairs (ri, cj) such that row ri and column cj are equal.

A row and column pair is considered equal if they contain the same elements in the same order (i.e., an equal array).

 
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[3,2,1],[1,7,6],[2,7,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 equal row and column pair:
- (Row 2, Column 1): [2,7,7]


Example 2:

Input: grid = [[3,1,2,2],[1,4,4,5],[2,4,2,2],[2,4,2,2]]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 equal row and column pairs:
- (Row 0, Column 0): [3,1,2,2]
- (Row 2, Column 2): [2,4,2,2]
- (Row 3, Column 2): [2,4,2,2]


 
Constraints:


	n == grid.length == grid[i].length
	1 <= n <= 200
	1 <= grid[i][j] <= 105

```py
class Solution:
    def equalPairs(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        count = {}

        for row in grid:
            row = tuple(row)
            count[row] = count.get(row,0)+1
        
        answer = 0

        n = len(grid)
        
         
        
        for col in range(n):
            column = []

            for row in range(n):
                column.append(grid[row][col])
            
            column = tuple(column)

            answer += count.get(column,0)

        return answer
